=> NLP  is a field in computer science and AI that gives machiens an ability to understand human language and to assist in language related tasks.



			Types of NLP

=> Rules and heuristics : using regular expressions
=> Machine learning : naive bayes (count vectorizer)	
=> Deep learing : better than machine learning (sentence embeddings)

- NLP can be used in following areas:
	* text classifier:
		- first the text will be vectorised using TF-IDF vectorizer than we using naive bayes classifier we can classify it.

	* text matching:
		- it is used in resume to sort out the resume that matches the given description
	
	* information retrieval:
		- like google search 
	
	* chatbots:
		- FaQ chatbots, Flow-based bots, Open ended bots like siri.
