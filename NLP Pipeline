=> It consists of the following steps:
  - Data acquisition
  - Text extraction & clean up

Preprocessing:
  - Sentence segmentation
  - Word tokenisation
  - Stemming: conversion to the base word (basically removing -ing, etc)
  - Lemmatization: conversion to base word using grammer (ate - eat)

Feature Engineering: 
  - Extracting features from raw data/ Text Representation
  - TF-IDF, One hot encoding, Word Embedding, Bag of words

Model Builing:
  
Evaluation:
  - Confusion matrix, F1 score, accuracy, etc.
  - And if we did not achieve the target accuracy we start back from the preprocessing step.

Deployment & Monitor/Update:
  - If the model is not performing well or outdated, you start from the beginning {data acquisition}
